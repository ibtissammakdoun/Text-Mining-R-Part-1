Real-time systems have guaranteed response times that can be sub-seconds from the trigger. Meaning that when a user clicks a button, your app better respond and fast. Architecting applications under real-time constraints is an even bigger challenge when you're dealing with big data. Luckily, big data technology and efficient architecture can provide the real-time responsiveness your business needs. In this course, you can learn about use cases and best practices for architecting real-time applications with technologies such as Kafka, Hazelcast, and Apache Spark.
